# Covid19 Question Answering System

For this project, I developed a Question Answering System utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques tailored to address inquiries related to the COVID-19 topic. You can find more details of each step in the [code](https://github.com/DoDucNhan/Covid19_QA/blob/main/code.ipynb) and [report](https://github.com/DoDucNhan/Covid19_QA/blob/main/report.pdf). A demo is also available through this [link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/GuzmanDo/COVID-19_QA).
